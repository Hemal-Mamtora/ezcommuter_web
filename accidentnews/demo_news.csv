However, the police aretaking the tragedy as a wakeup call to initiate proactive measures to preventfurther accidents on the Pallippuram-Mangalapuram stretch, which has alreadybeen notorious as an accident-prone stretch.  The Attingal police subdivision have served notices to officials of NationalHighway Authority of India, local body authorities, representatives ofresidents and other stake holders to convene a meeting to improve theconditions here.    As per the statistics available with the police, the stretch of NationalHighway 47 between Pallippuram and Mangalapuram is an accident-prone areawhich has witnessed hundreds of accidents over the past five years, in which29 people were killed. This is the fourth fatal accident in the stretch thisyear.    The four kilometre stretch between Pallippuram and Mangalapuram have at leastfive accident-prone areas. They are Mangalapuram, Thamarakkulam, Kurakkodu,CRPF camp region and Pallippuram.    Out of the 29 fatal accidents reported in the past five years, nine occurredin the CRPF camp region, making it the most vulnerable spot. Pallippuram andKurakkodu came second with six fatal accidents each. Thamarakkulam haswitnessed five deaths and Mangalapuram, three.    A record of total number of accidents in the region hasn’t been compiled yet,but, sources in the police say the number of accidents - including minor andmajor - would be more than 500 over past five years.    Mangalapuram police station’s principal sub -inspector J Ajayan said that thepolice have already been maintaining vigil at these spots.    “We ensure maximum police presence at these spots. For example, there is adangerous curve ahead of Kurakodu Junction and the highway police squad ispresent at the curve during nights. Sadly, most of the time the motoristsignore the police personnel and speed off,” the SI said.    “We have marked this stretch as a black spot of accidents. The road here isnarrow and devoid of a median. During nights the problem intensifies becausethe road is poorly lit with very few streetlights,” said Attingal deputysuperintendent of police P Anilkumar, adding that it was beyond the capacityof the police to solve the problems here. Hence, they decided to reach out tovarious stakeholders to make the stretch safe for motorists till the proposedroad widening works were carried out here.    Meanwhile, Mangalapuram–Pallippuram region is not the only area the AttingalDSP is focussed on.    “My subdivision is special because of two important roads, NH 47 and MC Road,and both roads have fair share of black spots. Thottakkad region nearKallambalam on the NH and Pulimath near Kilimanoor on the MC Road are twoother spots which need special attention owing to the high number ofaccidents,” Anilkumar said.    "

A joint inspection is likely to be carriedout on these corridors by traffic police and government departments to see howthey can be made safer.    A transport department official also said, “There are some dangerous busshelters, such as the one near Bhikaji Cama Place that is located right nextto the point where the flyover on Ring Road ends and is, therefore, dangerousfrom the safety point of view. A survey will be carried out to reveal whethersuch stops need to be relocated.”    The official revealed that the meeting decided that a road safety committeewould henceforth investigate every road incident scientifically and implementtraffic engineering interventions.    The expert said that PWD will soon create a road safety committee for themajor roads, as will the municipal corporations to maintain the smaller,colony roads. He added that emphasis would also be on road safety nearschools, with teachers being trained in how to implement road safety measures.    Those attending the meeting added that it was decided to chalk out a calendarof training programmes for engineers of PWD and the municipal corporations onroad engineering and traffic engineering. “In many cases, the road engineersare not well trained about traffic engineering and road safety measures. Thiscan often lead to deficiencies in risk-free roads,” the transport departmentofficial said.

Even a spark can lead to a major fire incident and these peopleare sitting on powder keg, sources said.    Following the incident on Thursday, Congress MLA from Ludhiana Eastconstituency Sanjay Talwar wrote a letter to deputy commissioner PardeepAgrawal, MC commissioner K P Brar, police commissioner S S Gill and mayorBalkar Sandhu for taking action against such people who are not takingpreventive measures.    He mentioned in the letter that in the past too, several fire incidents hadtaken place due to storage of hosiery waste.    MLA Sanjay Talwar said, “I had raised this issued earlier too, but nobody paidattention towards the same. On Thursday, a similar incident happened whichdamaged three houses.” He said people store hosiery waste at their houses andthere are narrow lanes in these areas. “If fire had spread in adjoining houseson Thursday, the situation might have gone out of control as most of thehouses were full of similar hosiery waste,” he said.    Meanwhile, a resident of area on the condition of anonymity said, “I amdealing in this business since 1992. In 1998, I had constructed this housewhere I store hosiery material on the ground floor. But after this incident, Ihave decided to shift my godown in some other area.”    He said there are many areas like Kripal Nagar, Gopal Nagar, Subhash Nagarwhere a similar practice as prevalent. Inhabited mostly by the migrant people,they deal in this business to run their households.    A random visit to these areas made the picture clear. Without following anybylaws, small houses have come up in narrow lanes with most of the familiesstoring hosiery waste on the ground floor.

The state public works department (PWD) approved a resolution in this regardon January 9. Most of these accident spots are in the remote, rural areas ofthe state. Many of them are accident-prone because of development andmaintenance issues.    Accident black spots are 500m stretches of road, where either five seriousaccidents (involving fatalities/grievous injuries) or 10 accident-relatedfatalities have occurred in the past three calendar years.    The resolution said for the improvement of such black spots a systematicapproach is required. The rectification work will be time-bound and there willbe a monitoring mechanism as well.    Temporary and permanent measures will be taken. Temporary measures willinclude the rectification of damages to the road structure that cause unsafetraffic condition; installation of road signs; road markings; speed reductionmeasures like providing strips; and traffic calming measures. The progress ofthe short-term measures would be regularly reported to the road safety cell atthe regional and state levels.

We have been told this so many times but refuse to learn. Everyavoidable death on the road is a tragedy and there have already been severalover the last couple of days. We hope that the city learns from theseaccidents so that the festive season, which is barely a fortnight away, isbetter.    The top-five roads on the list had contributed to half of all fatal accidentslast year. This year, the numbers are expected to be close to last year,claimed Lalbazar officers.    According to the Kolkata Police survey, 54 deaths have been reported on EMBypass between 2015 and 2017. This year, another 10 have died till Octoberthis year. “There are no demarcated crossovers even though there has been apopulation explosion on both sides of the speed corridor. Temporary guardwalls are often breached and illegal crossovers made. For example, when we putup guardrails in between Ruby crossing and Tagore Park, we found at leastthree breaches within a week. Similarly, there are issues regarding movementof cars due to the construction work going on,” said a source from the localtraffic guard.    Lalbazar sources, however, claimed that everything has been experimented withto control speed on the stretch. “A major change in street furniture — likesetting up of additional traffic signals — has brought down the number ofaccidents at Chingrighata. Now, instead of pedestrians, speeding and recklessdriving are leading to accidents,” said a senior officer from the planningdepartment.    “We hold naka checks each day and we are adding more speed guns and automaticnumber-plate recognition cameras to try and stop accidents like the one thattook place on Monday night,” claimed a Lalbazar officials. “There isn’t anyone reason behind the rise in the number of deaths on roads that were onceconsidered comparatively safe. Good road condition, a sudden urge to speed,inadequate lighting and the rise in the number of pedestrians on thecarriageways are all to blame,” said an officer from the fatal squad oftraffic police.    Besides EM Bypass and DH Road, the cops are also worried about Circular GardenReach Road and Strand Road. “We have intensified surveillance and enforcedprosecution against rash driving in these areas, besides placing Karma(Kolkata Accident Rescue and Medical Attention) ambulances at strategicpoints,” said a police officer.

After its inauguration in 2015, Barodians have witnessedseveral fatal accidents taking place on it, while in the last two monthsalone, four persons have died in three major accidents here. These accidentshave now raised questions over the design of the city’s longest flyoverconstructed at the cost of Rs 62.98 crore.    “The flyover takes a sharp turn, a spot where a lot of accidents take place.This is a major design flaw in the flyover. The problem is that VadodaraMunicipal Corporation (VMC) never consults with the police before designingand constructing flyovers,” a senior police official said, lamenting that thepolice are always blamed first when accidents take place. “If we wereconsulted, we could have given key inputs to improve the flyovers’ design andtraffic engineering,” he added.    “We are in talks with the VMC to work out a solution to avoid accidents,” saidcity police commissioner, Anupam Singh Gahlaut, while talking to TOI.    In-charge VMC city engineer P M Patel, however, said that the flyovers areplanned only after detailed studies by competent agencies. “Rail IndiaTechnical and Economic Service (RITES) Ltd had conducted the first study. Amore recent study was done by the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI). BothRITES and CRRI are extremely competent agencies,” Patel argued.    Satyen Kulabkar, a traffic expert confirmed that the sharp turn on the flyoveris indeed a major design fault. “There is little coordination between VMC andthe police department while constructing such flyovers. Many other flyoversand bridges in the city too have faulty designs. Ironically, while the VMCdesigns and constructs the flyovers, it is the police that bears the brunt ofblames when such fatal accidents happen,” he said.    "

Of the seventeen wards, sixteen wereaffected in the recent deluge,” said panchayat president P P Babu.    “We also plan to make changes in the crop cultivation. Crops which withstandfloods will be cultivated in areas that are prone to inundation. We will alsohave to identify safe zones to rehabilitate residents in case of anemergency,” Babu said.    SCMS Water Institute, Karukutty, will conduct a field study as part of theproject. “MTech environmental engineering students of our college, guided bythe faculty, will conduct the study prior to formulating the floodpreparedness plan. We will prepare a comprehensive plan after compiling andanalysing the data collected,” said SCMS Water Institute 4 director SunnyGeorge.    “We expect that it will be a model for the entire state. Rainfall data will beprocured from India Meteorological Department and features of agriculture andcultivation in the area will be collected from agricultural research station,Chalakudy. River flow data and topological maps will be procured from theCentral Water Commission and Survey of India, respectively. Satellite datawill be collected from Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) and reservoirlevel and shutter opening data would also be collected,” said George.    Detailed data collection would be carried out in the affected wards using asmartphone appbased questionnaire. Flood water level, spatial extent, durationof inundation and level of water will be documented using open data kit (ODK).Soil and well water samples will also be collected and analysed.    Using the GIS, various zones based on flood levels will be prepared. Optimumevacuation routes and appropriate locations for relief camps will also beprepared.    “We will analyse the direction of flood water flow and isolated areas. Thiswill help us prepare safe evacuation routes and relief camps,” Babu said.Communication system for giving early warning to residents will also bedeveloped. Agricultural risk map would be prepared for rearranging the croppattern in various parts of the village. The total cost of the project,including procuring equipment for emergency rescue force, is Rs 25 lakh and itwill be borne by the panchayat.    "

Around 75 mohallas and slums in Dehradun are already facing water scarcitywith much of them being fed through nine nigam and 27 private water tankers.“No serious case of water crisis has yet come to our notice but the peakseason is to begin now and that is when the pressure is maximum. But we haveour own tankers and we have also acquired some private tankers to meet thedemands of the peak season,” said LK Adlakha, OSD Jal Sansthan. Adlakha alsosaid that the nigam is actively maintaining the damaged pipelines andinstalling hand-pumps in the area that are prone to water crisis.  However, locals said that the water being provided is not enough. “We getaround two to three tankers here but that is not enough. Also the quality ofthe water is not good for drinking so we buy drinking water and use the tankerwater for other purposes,” said Ganesh Thapa, a resident of Nehrugram inRaipur.    Locals added that the complaints to Jal Sansthan go unanswered. In the monthof April itself, more than 1,700 complaints were filed around 240 of which arestill pending. This led to people’s anger getting spilled when earlier thisweek, the drinking water minister, Prakash Pant met with people’s ire when hevisited Jal Sansthan customer care centre in Rajpur. Residents shouted slogansagainst the minister demanding that they be provided with clean drinkingwater.    Of all the areas in Dehradun, Raipur is most prone to water scarcity. Of the75 mohallas and slums that are going through water shortage, 35 are in Raipuritself. According to Jal Sansthan officials, rise in population of the areahas been the major cause of water scarcity in the area. “Because more and morecolonies are being built in the area, the pressure in the pipeline hasdecreased and the water cannot be pumped to areas that are at the far end,”said a nigam official.    Other areas of Dehradun that are facing water shortage are Bhauwala and Jollygrant on the outer edge of the city, Sahastradhara road in northern part ofthe city and Rajpur road and Salawala in southern part of the city."

Residential buildings should be banned in the areas which are more prone toflooding (time interval of 10 years), said Thummarukudy. Speaking at aprogramme organized by Kerala Management Association in Kochi on Friday, hesaid that dam break analyses and action plan for controlled water release fromdams should be prepared.    Thummarrukudy said that he had written on June 14, giving warning that damswould be filled soon given the rate of heavy rainfall and situation will goout of control if urgent measures are not taken.    “The flood was entirely predictable and preventable. Unlike other naturalcalamities, flood will not result in many casualties, if there is adequateplanning and preparation to meet the calamity. Rivers had been encroachedupon. In many areas like Cheruthoni, there is rampant encroachment,” he said.    People living in 2km radius of rivers could have been given SMS alerts on theimminent disaster. There should be a dam break analysis as well as floodmapping of such areas, he said.    He added that the dams in Kerala would be reduced into ‘tourist attractions’within 50 years.    “The philosophy of dams has become outdated. Solar energy will become commonby that time,” Thummarukudy said.    “The rescue and relief operations in Kerala were exemplary but the rebuildingpart is of very much importance. A ‘green method’ should be adopted forrebuilding. If we plan to construct whatever was there, we will be passing ondisasters to future generations. Evacuation shelters should be ensured in theareas in flood-prone areas,” added Thummarukudy.    "

Worry not, get alerts on your mobile phone",2018-02-19T01:04:01+05:30,"Tirunelveli: The district administration has come up with a novel initiativeto make the disaster alert system more effective by sending the messages tothe people, in the 125 vulnerable areas in the district, to their mobilephones. Those who have installed the ‘Namma Nellai’ app launched by thedistrict administration will get an alert on it, while others will get an SMS.  “The alert mechanisms have got shape. We are in the process of feeding mobilenumbers of people living in vulnerable areas in the system. We are also in theprocess of developing an outbound voice call in Tamil to alert those whocannot read SMS,” said district collector Sandeep Nanduri. He told TOI thatthis alert mechanism will be fully ready to alert nearly 2.5 lakh people inthese areas before the onset of the southwest Monsoon in July.    Traditionally, alerts on disaster such as flooding was passed on by themeteorology department or agencies concerned with the district collector anddistrict disaster management agency. From here the message is then passed tothe local revenue authorities and announced to people in the low lying areasthrough tom-tom criers or speakers tied to vehicles. As this was timeconsuming, it did not reach every nook and corner.    Last year the district administration initiated ‘First Responder’ in which 10youths were identified in each of the 125 vulnerable areas. These 1,250persons will get a call from the district disaster management control room andthey in turn will alert people about the possibility of flooding or othernatural disasters.    This was more effective than the traditional alert mechanism, but still timeconsuming as the time taken for the alert to reach the last person took up toan hour. In this case there was the possibility of human prioritising inalerting their near and dear ones first, which was unavoidable.    “To quicken the alerts and inform everyone at the same time, we mappedvulnerable areas through geofencing. When the disaster control room gets analert from the India Meteorology Department (IMD), the personnel there willscan a QR code to create an alert and select the localities. A pin number withthe alert will then be sent to the collector, to avoid false alerts,” said C PSiva Raju of YTR Technologies that is working on the alert.    Once the collector enters the pin, the alert will be sent to all the mobilephones in that locality in one go. The alert system will cover as many as 10natural and one man-made disaster in three stages of alert for each scenariowatch, warn and alert. “We have mobile numbers of the people in the rationshops and other government schemes. So no additional effort is needed tocollect it,” the collector added.    "

Doctors were, however, quick toreiterate that this is a ‘general observation’ based on feedback from theirpeers and no scientific study has yet been initiated.  Dr Krishnan Lahoti, president of IDA Nagpur, says they are working on plans tocollate data and to conduct a proper scientific survey in the near future.    “We do not have any medical research on the cause-effect side of these generalobservations. It seems to me that areas where magnesium, iron and zinc are inexcess, such dental issues crop up. Hopefully, soon we will do a medicalsurvey and try to observe this in greater detail in a scientific manner and bein a better position to connect the dots,” said Dr Lahoti.    This phenomenon is being noticed in polluted areas of Vidarbha likeChandrapur. “Industrial pollution is definitely a common factor, a linkbetween dental problems and pre-school age children,” said Dr VaibhavKaremore.    Apart from industrial pollution, the common problems of excess fluorine indrinking water causing yellowing of teeth continues to be an issue in someplaces.    Dr Lahoti said, “It does not happen everywhere, but whenever we notice it webring it to the notice of the authorities so that quantity of fluorine can bescaled down.”    The doctors were speaking on the sidelines of a two-day conference hosted byIDA Nagpur to showcase latest dental surgical equipment and processinnovations. Dr Ankur Dhoot, secretary of organization, said, “At theconference, expert speakers from across the country also shared best practiceswith the delegates. We have a company from Israel that showcased a dentalimplant which has an inbuilt drill.”    Dr Lahoti said such conferences help everyone upgrade their knowledge. “Apartfrom lectures, we had a technical exhibition as well.

Over the past one month, officials have been brainstorming on how to preventflooding of the underpass — the project that was expedited after the infamous2016 Gurujam to keep traffic on the NH-8 moving evening during rains. Whiledistrict and NHAI officials have come up with varied explanations— like poordrainage, breaking down of pump sets, etc. — since then, others pointed outflaws in the underpass design.    Some experts, however, said the project itself was ill-conceived and thatthere should not have been an underpass at this junction, which is essentiallya flood-prone area, in the first place.    Professor Sewa Ram of School of Planning and Architecture said, “Theauthorities should not have planned an underpass at this crossing. Thisparticular point has been getting waterlogged every monsoon for the past 25-30years. This junction is located in a low-lying area and thus, flooding isnormal.”    Former Union secretary (urban development) Sudhir Krishna seconded Ram. “Ithink, the authorities should have made a flyover at Hero Honda Chowk instead.A flyover would have solved the problem of jams and prevented flooding on thestretch,” he said.    However, Dr S Velmurugan, the head of traffic engineering and safety atCentral Road Research Institute (CRRI), seeks to differ on this. “An underpassat any point is not an issue, but its drainage is. If Hero Honda Chowkunderpass has proper drains or not is the question main here. The underpassshould have a drainage pit at every 25 metres to prevent flooding inside thepassage,” he explained. NHAI officials insisted the underpass wasconceptualised back in 2007, long before the Gurujam happened.    “The underpass and the flyover, both were part of the Hero Honda Chowkproject. There is nothing wrong with this structure,” said a senior NHAIofficial.    Ravinder Singh Yadav, team leader of Indian Technocrat Limited (ITL) and NHAIengineer consultant for the project, claimed that the underpass was built onthe demand of common people, who faced a lot of problems while crossing thejunction on a daily basis.

The Odhav area on the SP Ring Road is the most dangerous, having seen 87accidents, 20 of which resulted in death. This is followed by the stretch atNaroda, with 85 accidents of which 16 were fatal. In the western part of thecity, Sarkhej and Bopal areas registered 38 and 28 accidents respectively. TheAslali and Adalaj Circles and interchange junctions witnessed 17 fatalaccidents each.    The study was carried out with help from Ahmedabad city police. “We found 18spots, including junctions and roundabouts on SP Ring Road that were the mostprone to accidents. Improper signage and irregular road geometry at some spotswere found to be some of the reasons,” Amin told TOI. The study also points tothe top mean speeds of vehicles, referred to as the ‘98th speed percentile’,at eight spots on SP Ring Road was between 80.35kmph and 72.86kmph, far toohigh for city roads.

The area is also densely populated as a number of colonies have been developednear the highway. The traffic problem at this busy square gets compounded whenpeople from nearby rural areas also prefer to pass through it. The residentscomplain that drivers, especially those of heavy vehicles who cross thissection, hardly adhere to permissible speed limits. And with a number ofschools in the vicinity, such kind of reckless driving only increases the riskof accidents in the area.    Those who commute through this square regularly say that during rains,visibility on the road drops significantly in the night as street lightshardly function. As such, cases of four-wheelers hitting other vehiclesespecially two-wheelers, go up.    The movement of vehicles has also hampered by the ongoing construction of anoverbridge in the area.    Residents of the area say that there are hardly any traffic personnel postedin the area to keep check on speeding vehicles and errant drivers. They saythat besides posting significant number of cops, the traffic department shouldalso set up barricades to control speeding in the area.    Traffic experts suggested that diverting traffic coming from city would helpreduce number of accidents. “As road from the city opens directly onto theBypass, the vehicles get stuck up in the heavy traffic flow on Bypass.Authorities should close down this direct opening and traffic should bediverted thorough an underpass near Kanadiya area,” says Prafulla Joshi,traffic expert.    “As the installation of speed breakers is not possible on the road, measureslike putting up barricades and signage boards can help control increasingnumber of accidents,” he said.

The Khandala tunnel was built through the Khambatki mountain pass forseparating two-way vehicular movement on the Pune-Kolhapur stretch which ispart of the National Highway 4 that goes to Bengaluru. It is used by trafficheading from Kolhapur to Pune. The entire stretch is controlled and maintainedby the National Highways Authority of India.      Vehicles emerging from the tunnel have to negotiate a dangerous `S’ shapedroad which has a steep gradient and this has been a cause of frequentaccidents. Often, vehicle users fail to anticipate the sharp turn soon afteremerging from the tunnel and end up losing control over the wheels. Roadsafety experts have often raised their concern over the faulty design of the`S’ shaped road and have repeatedly sought corrective measures to curbaccidents.      "

Of the total number of victims,over 60% were two-wheeler riders and over 70% of the fatal road accidents tookplace either at NH-16 or at some major state highways in the district.    Speaking to TOI, a retired road transport officer and member of road safetycommittee, Visakhapatnam, AH Khan said, at a recent meeting, districtcollector K Bhaskar asked the police and RTA to form special teams toscientifically investigate all fatal road accidents by visiting the accidentscene to ascertain the exact reasons for the accidents.    In some cases, the police mentions the various reasons for the accident in thefirst information report to conclude the case, but the details may not beaccurate.    In the detailed study of the accidents, which the teams will undertake, crashcausation, injuries, vehicles involved in the crash, among others factors,will be studied, based on which the authorities will take decisions, he added.    The special teams, comprising traffic officials and RTA personnel, areexpected to scientifically evaluate the scene of accident, taking into accountthe impact damage, tyre marks and few others. The teams will also takefeedback from motorists to identify black spot areas (accident-prone areas).    They will then submit a report to the road safety committee. The teams willalso have to make recommendations such as changes in road-engineering, speedlimit and others to mitigate the accidents.    “Call it negligence or thrill”, over-speeding is one the major reasons in over60% of the fatal road-accidents. It is not so easy to check over-speeding andnegligent driving round the clock, said ADCP (traffic) M Ramesh Kumar.    Sources said the teams will also study the the accidents in which RTC buseshave been involved, as there are several complaints, which have been lodged,against RTC bus drivers, accusing them of negligence and rash driving.

The move comes a day before the scheduled release of water from Metturand the silt still not removed from rivers and channels in the delta region.    The survey for the mapping has been launched by the department of revenueadministration and disaster management in coordination with experts from AnnaUniversity to ensure mitigation steps and immediate response to naturaldisasters in Nagapattinam district. “The survey is meant to identify disaster-prone or physically inaccessible areas with aerial images and accuratepictures of the water courses in the district. This will help us identify thelocation of dams, missing links of canals and ensure possible opportunitiesfor interlinking of water courses,” tahsildar for Disaster Management Agency SThamimun Ansari told TOI. The process would take three months to complete andthe final report would be submitted to the state government, he added.    A total of 36 rivers including Cauvery, Vennaru, GA canal and 28,000 othercanals (canals have been categorized as A, B, C, D, E, F and G), are spreadacross the Cauvery delta region. The water bodies and canals are spread over9,000 square kilometres in the delta region mostly comprising Thanjavur,Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur districts.    Of the 28,000 canals, ‘A’ type canals alone are 1,665 in number, flowing forabout 7,000 kilometres across the delta districts. Hence, farmers pointed outthat it was impossible to desilt the entire system within six or seven daysbefore the water reached them. “The revenue officials can utilize the MGNREGAworkers to execute the work on a war footing and ensure that it is finishedbefore the water released from Mettur reservoir touches the fields”, thegeneral secretary of Federation of Farmers Associations - Cauvery Delta TamilNadu, Arupathy P Kalyanam said.
